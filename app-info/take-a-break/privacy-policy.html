       <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
       <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in Take a (sync) Break 
           (Referred to below as "The Application") for iOS and MacOS.</p>
       <p>Effective Date: August 17, 2020</p>
       <h2>Information Collection, Use and Sharing</h2>
       <p>The Application does not collect, store or share any personal information.</p>
       <p>The Application stores only data relevant to its core functionality. 
           That data does not leave your device (phone, tablet or computer) unless you 
           explicitly share it.</p>
        <p>When you open The Application you might be asked to allow Notifications.
            This is part of the core functionality and The Application uses notifications to inform you
            when a time interval or a time pattern has ended. The Application will never send you a notification that 
            is not related to this functionality.
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, without notice. 
            It is your responsibility to review the Privacy Policy periodically. 
            By continuing to use The Application means that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>
